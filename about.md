Web developer who loves to build apps which'll help millions, if not billions.

### More Information

When l'm not working, am usually with my three year Labrador, who loves to run and exercise even more than I do. I love to play video games, and travel whenever I can.

I love meeting new people and learning new things. Always up for a challenge.
