I"W<p>Recently I was faced with the situation where I had to use SVG icons in my web app. What did I do next? Wrapped the SVG in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Img&gt;</code> tag and went with it. It worked obviously, but it had its own shortcomings. This is what I’m going to discuss today.</p>

<p>Let’s get started with discussing the cons of wrapping a svg in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Img&gt;</code> tag:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limited CSS based styling.</li>
  <li>In-line styling is required for some of them to work.</li>
  <li>External Stylesheets have no effect on them except for few basic modifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-should-i-use-then">What should I use then?</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at the syntax for all of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image Tag <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img src="./sample.svg" alt="Sample SVG" /&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Object Tag <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;object data="sample.svg" type="image/svg+xml"&gt; &lt;img src="fallback.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/object&gt; </code></li>
</ul>

<p>Next up ww’ve two contenders here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Object&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Embed&gt;</code> tag. Let’s see which one is better.</p>
