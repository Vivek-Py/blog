I"¦<p>You must have a seen a controversial, sparking conversations on Reddit and Twitter recently. People were debating over usage of Let and Const.</p>

<p><img src="../images/let-vs-const.jpg" alt="Let vs Const Thumbnail" /></p>

<p>It seems that netizens believe that one should use const wherever possible, only falling back to let where necessary, as can be enforced with the prefer-const <strong>ESLint rule</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let vs Const vs Var: We generally want to use let. If weâ€™re not using the same, we use const. (Iâ€™ve heard some codebases and coworkers are pedantic and, force you to use const when there is only one assignment.)</p>
