I"¹<p>If you havenâ€™t heard of TDD, it means Test Driven Development. What do I mean by that? Letâ€™s talk about it today.</p>

<h2 id="lets-make-sense">Letâ€™s make sense</h2>

<p>Test-driven development (aka TDD) is a three-step process. Itâ€™s often referred to as the â€œred, green, refactor cycleâ€</p>

</p>

<p>Let me explain the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Red</strong>: It involves writing a function to test a feature which youâ€™re going to add in the project/app. Itâ€™ll fail onbviously and you get a red error message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Green</strong>: Next up, we add the functionality/feature to the app in-order to pass the test and you get a green success message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refactor</strong>: Now we need to look at the code and refactor it to ensure itâ€™s well-written, and easy to read/understand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You repeat the same process over and over again until you have added all the required functionality.
Bonus: Using this cycle saves you if you break something while implementing other functionalities.</p>
