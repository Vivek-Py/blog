I"<p>If you haven’t heard of TDD, it means Test Driven Development. What do I mean by that? Let’s talk about it today.</p>

<h2 id="lets-make-sense">Let’s make sense</h2>

<p>Test-driven development (aka TDD) is a three-step process. It’s often referred to as the “red, green, refactor cycle”</p>

</p>

<p>Let me explain the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Red</strong>: It involves writing a function to test a feature which you’re going to add in the project/app. It’ll fail onbviously and you get a red error message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Green</strong>: Next up, we add the functionality/feature to the app in-order to pass the test and you get a green success message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refactor</strong>: Now we need to look at the code and refactor it to ensure it’s well-written, and easy to read/understand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You repeat the same process over and over again until you have added all the required functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Using this cycle saves you if you break something while implementing other functionalities.</p>

<h2 id="but-when-does-it-make-sense">But when does it make sense?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Utility Functions</strong>: If I’ve a function which has a certain set of inputs or ouputs, and of a certain complexity. I prefer setting up a test for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components</strong>: If I’m rendering multiple components in an app, I prefer setting up a test for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fixing a bug</strong>: This also helps me in replicating the issue so that I can understand the problem better.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
