I"à<p>Iâ€™ve been working on React for months now, since the Iâ€™ve used tons of react libraries. To my belief, weâ€™ve seen quite new tools slowly replacing old libraires.</p>

<h1 id="for-components">For Components</h1>

<p>Component libraries help us develop better when we donâ€™t have strong styling directives. Most of the time, they provide us with additional features and remove a lot of biolerplate code.</p>

<h2 id="ant-design">Ant Design</h2>

<p>This react component provides some enterprise-level products. You donâ€™t need to worry about â€œnot being able to do the componentâ€ Youâ€™ll be able to get it done.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s still some things I donâ€™t like about Ant Design. If you want to customize Ant Design theme you need to use LESS or a tool to change LESS variables during your build. To me it feels a little too much to just update color variables.
Another thing to note is that Ant Design is a design system. It is meant to be opinionated. It gives you a set of rules to follow when using components and doesnâ€™t make it very easy when you want to use components outside of these use cases. Overall, it is a pleasure to use compared to Material UI and I can do everything I need very easily without any frustration.</p>
