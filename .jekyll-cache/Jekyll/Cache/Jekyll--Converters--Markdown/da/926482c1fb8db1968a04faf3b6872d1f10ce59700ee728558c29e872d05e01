I"ø<p>You must have a seen a controversial, sparking conversations on Reddit and Twitter recently. People were debating over usage of Let and Const.</p>

<p><img src="../images/let-vs-const.jpg" alt="Let vs Const Thumbnail" /></p>

<p>It seems that netizens believe that one should use const wherever possible, only falling back to let where necessary, as can be enforced with the prefer-const <strong>ESLint rule</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let vs Const vs Var: We generally want to use let. If weâ€™re not using the same, we use const. (Iâ€™ve heard some codebases and coworkers are pedantic and, force you to use const when there is only one assignment.)</p>

<h2 id="why-prefer-const">Why prefer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>One Way to Do It: It is mental overhead to have to choose between let and const every time. A rule like â€œalways use const where it worksâ€ lets you stop thinking about it and can be enforced by a linter.</li>
</ol>
