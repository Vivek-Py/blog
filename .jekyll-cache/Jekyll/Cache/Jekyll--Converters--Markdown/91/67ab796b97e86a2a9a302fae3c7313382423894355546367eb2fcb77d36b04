I"î<p>Iâ€™ve been working on React for months now, since the Iâ€™ve used tons of react libraries. To my belief, weâ€™ve seen quite new tools slowly replacing old libraires.</p>

<h1 id="for-components">For Components</h1>

<p>Component libraries help us develop better when we donâ€™t have strong styling directives. Most of the time, they provide us with additional features and remove a lot of biolerplate code.</p>

<h2 id="ant-design">Ant Design</h2>

<p>This react component provides some enterprise-level products. You donâ€™t need to worry about â€œnot being able to do the componentâ€ Youâ€™ll be able to get it done.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that Ant Design is a design system. It is meant to be opinionated. Overall, it is a fun to use compared to Material UI. Thereâ€™s still some things I donâ€™t like about Ant Design. If you want to customize Ant Design theme you need to change variables during your build. To me it feels like a lot of work for little things like changing colors.</p>
